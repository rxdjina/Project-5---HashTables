1. The worst-case time complexity for the private member function rehash() is O(n^2). Within the function there exists 
   a nested loop that first iterates through the lists , then the key-value within each list. This operation would take O(n^2) to complete.
   Another operation, makeEmpty() exists in this function which contains a loop that runs in O(n). All other operations within this function
   run in constant time. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of this function is O(n^2).
2. The worst-case time complexity for the member function removeUser(const string & k) is O(n^2). Within this function there exists an operation
    which calls remove() for our HashTable class. remove() contains a loop which will erase a value from our list if it is found. This loop run 
    in O(n^2). All other operations within this function in constant time. Therefore the worst-case time complexity of this function is O(n^2).
